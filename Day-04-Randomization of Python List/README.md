# 🎲 Day 04 – Randomization of Python List

This day focused on exploring **randomization** in Python and how lists can be manipulated in fun and practical ways.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- The `random` module and how to use it
- Understanding **offsets** in lists
- Adding items to lists using `.append()`
- Handling **IndexError**
- Working with **nested lists**

## 🧩 Exercises & Quiz
- **Who Will Pay the Bill Game**  
  Inspired by a popular finance-banker tradition in London where cards are tossed to decide who pays the bill.

## 🎮 Project of the Day
**Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
A simple, interactive game where the computer randomly chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the user competes against it.

## 💡 Reflection
Day 04 helped me see how randomness can make programs more dynamic and interactive. Whether it’s deciding who pays the bill or building games, the **random module** brings unpredictability to coding—making Python not just logical, but also fun!
