# 🎮 Hangman Game – Day 7 (100 Days of Python)

This project is part of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**.  
On **Day 7**, I built a complete **Hangman Game** using:

- Functions  
- Loops  
- Conditionals  
- Lists  
- ASCII art  
- Error handling  
- Game logic  

This version of Hangman selects a random word, displays blank spaces `_`, keeps track of lives, prevents repeated guesses, and shows hangman stages as the player loses lives.
