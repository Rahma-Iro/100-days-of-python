# Day 10 – Beginner Functions with Outputs

This folder contains my Day 10 progress from the **100 Days of Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu**.

## 🌟 What I Learned Today

### 1. Functions With Outputs
I learned how to use the `return` keyword to send values back from a function instead of only printing. This helps create reusable, modular code.

### 2. Multiple Return Values
I explored how a single function can return different results depending on conditions, making programs smarter and more dynamic.

### 3. Leap Year Challenge
I wrote a function that checks whether a year is a leap year using:
- divisible by 4
- except divisible by 100
- unless divisible by 400

This helped reinforce nested conditions and return logic.

### 4. Docstrings
I learned how to document functions using docstrings to explain what they do for anyone reading the code.

### 5. Function Quiz
A short quiz that tested my understanding of function outputs and flow control.

### 6. Calculator Project
The final task was building a simple calculator that:
- Stores operations in a dictionary
- Uses functions for each operation
- Handles continuous calculations
- Uses return statements for clean logic

## 📁 Files Included
- `main.py` – all exercises for the day
- `calculator.py` – the full calculator project
- `readme.md` – summary of the day’s progress

## 🧠 Key Takeaway
Today strengthened my understanding of writing clean, reusable, functional code. Learning how to return values opened the door to writing more logical and professional Python programs.
