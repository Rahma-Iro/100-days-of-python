# Day 13 of 100 Days of Python: Debugging in Python 🐛

Welcome to **Day 13** of my Python journey! Today, we focused on **debugging**, an essential skill for every programmer. Debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors (bugs) in your code. Even experienced developers spend a significant amount of time debugging, so mastering it early is crucial.

## What We Learned

### 1. Describe the Problem
Before attempting to fix a bug, clearly define **what the code is supposed to do**. Understanding the intended behavior helps you identify where it goes wrong.

### 2. Reproduce the Bug
Mentally step through the code line by line, as if you were the Python interpreter. This helps spot logical errors.

### 3. Play Computer and Evaluate Each Line
Mentally step through the code line by line, as if you were the Python interpreter. This helps spot logical errors.

### 4. Fix Errors and Watch for Red Underlines
Modern IDEs (like PyCharm, VSCode) highlight syntax and semantic errors. Pay attention—they guide you to problems in your code.

### 5. Squash Bugs with a `print()` Statement
Use `print()` to check variable values or program flow. It’s one of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques.

### 6. Use Try/Except for Input Errors
Handle user input safely using `try/except` blocks. This prevents your program from crashing due to invalid inputs.

### 7. Bring Out the BIG Gun: Using a Debugger
- Step through your code line by line.  
- Inspect variables at different stages.  
- Great for complex programs where print statements aren’t enough.

### 8. Rest Then Come Back
If you’re stuck on a bug, **take a break**. A fresh perspective often helps identify problems quickly.

### 9. Run Your Code Often
Test small portions of code frequently instead of waiting until the end.  
This prevents accumulating multiple bugs and makes debugging easier.

### 10. Ask a Friend or Use Stack Overflow
Sometimes another perspective helps. Don’t hesitate to ask peers or consult online resources for tricky issues.
