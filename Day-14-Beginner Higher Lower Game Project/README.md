# 100 Days of Python - Day 14: Higher or Lower Game

Welcome to Day 14 of my 100 Days of Python journey! In this project, I built the **Higher or Lower Game**, where the player guesses which account has more followers.

## 📝 Project Description

The **Higher or Lower Game** is a simple interactive game where:
- Two accounts are shown on the screen with some information (name, description, and country).
- The player must guess which account has more followers on Instagram.
- If the player guesses correctly, their score increases by 1 and the next round begins.
- If the guess is wrong, the game ends and the final score is displayed.

The goal is to see how many correct guesses the player can make consecutively.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this project, I practiced:
1. Working with **lists and dictionaries**.
2. Using **functions** for modular code:
   - Formatting data (`format_data`)
   - Checking answers (`check_answer`)
3. Implementing **loops** to continue the game.
4. Handling **random choices** using Python’s `random` module.
5. Managing game **state and score tracking**.
6. Keeping the **code clean and readable**.

## 🛠 Features

- Displays two accounts to compare with clear formatting.
- Randomly picks accounts for each round.
- Checks the player's guess and updates the score.
- Uses ASCII art to make the game visually appealing.
- Ensures the same account is never shown twice in a round.
- Clears the console between rounds for a smooth user experience.

## ⚡ How to Play

1. Run `Higher_Lower_Game.py`.
2. View the two accounts shown on the screen.
3. Type `A` if you think account A has more followers.
4. Type `B` if you think account B has more followers.
5. If correct, continue to the next round. If wrong, the game ends.
6. Your score is displayed at the end.
