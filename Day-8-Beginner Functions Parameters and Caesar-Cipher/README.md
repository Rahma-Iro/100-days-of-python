# Day 8 – Python Functions, Love Calculator, and Caesar Cipher

## Overview
On Day 8, we focused on understanding **functions with inputs**, using **positional and keyword arguments**, and applying them in real-world exercises. We also explored **string manipulation** and basic **encryption techniques**.

## Topics Covered
1. **Functions with Inputs**
   - Using parameters to make functions dynamic
   - Positional vs keyword arguments

2. **Life in Weeks**
   - Calculated remaining weeks if lifespan is 90 years
   - Used f-strings for formatted output

3. **Love Calculator**
   - Built a program to calculate compatibility scores between two names
   - Counted occurrences of letters in names
   - Combined counts to form a love score

4. **Caesar Cipher**
   - Encrypt messages by shifting letters
   - Decrypt messages by reversing the shift
   - Combined encryption and decryption into a single function

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-link>
