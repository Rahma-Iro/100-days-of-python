# Day 9: Dictionaries in Python

Welcome to Day 9 of the **100 Days of Python** challenge!  

This day focused on **dictionaries** – one of Python's most versatile data structures. Here's what was covered:

## Topics Learned
- Creating dictionaries
- Accessing, updating, and deleting entries
- Looping through dictionaries
- Nested lists and nested dictionaries
- Practical application: Blind auction project

## Projects
### Blind Auction
A mini-project where multiple bidders can place their bids anonymously. Using dictionaries, the program tracks all bids and determines the winner automatically.

### Examples
```python
programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents it from running as expected.",
    "Function": "A piece of code you can call over and over again.",
}

print(programming_dictionary["Function"])  # Accessing values
